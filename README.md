#assert-browser

Implements some of the `assert` functions from node.js

For use in the browser.

[See the tests run](http://assert.the.tl)


Added stuff on top of the normal assert:

    * `assert.count` : Count of all asserts made
    * `assert.passCount`: Count of all tests that passed
    * `assert.failCount`: Count of all tests that failed
